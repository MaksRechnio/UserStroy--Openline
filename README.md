ðŸ‘• Clothesline â€“ SwiftUI Clothing Carousel

Clothesline is a playful SwiftUI app that lets users swipe through a horizontally scrollable rack of virtual clothing items. Each item includes a title, image, and author, and can be expanded for more details or edited/deleted. New clothing items can also be added through a modal form.

This is the stable version using a standard TabView carousel â€” no curved scrolling logic here. Just a clean, functional, and animated SwiftUI UI.
